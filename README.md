# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using MRI with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI scans into four distinct categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The model leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify tumor types based on MRI imaging data, providing a valuable tool for medical diagnostics and research.
